# What is the Turquoise 2D project?

Turquoise 2D is an open source level/game editor software aimed for developing games using many game frameworks (currently Cocos2d-x is the only supported framework). 

If you want to make your own game editor to any game framework,  maybe this might be a good start. Improve it and help its improving!

# What is the purpose of the project?
Turquoise2D allows you to design levels for your video game and create user interfaces. 

Turquoise2D currently supports Only Cocos2d-x, you're welcome to contribute and add support for other game engine.

# At which stage is the project now?
Currently there are many things that are missing and need to be improved, for instance, it only supports Cocos2d-x projects. Maybe you could integrate other framework or add new features to it.

# Which UI library used?
It's written using QT. We chose QT because it's simple, fast and cross platform.

# License
Turquoise2D licensed with Zlib license.
